## now

I have been trying my best to have a lot of meaningful things to do every moment of my life. Here's what I have been up to lately:

- Living in BSD City, ID;
- Product & engineering at [Persol APAC](https://www.persol-group.co.jp/en/);
- Reading a lot of books, articles, and newsletters (mostly from the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com));
  - Currently reading [The Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138825075-the-book);
- Writing more:
  - On my [journal](https://hisam.dev/journals) and on [my pen and paper](https://hisam.dev/uses);
  - Grow my [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) ðŸŒ±;
- Building [CakeAuth](https://cakeauth.com) - an authentication as a service;
