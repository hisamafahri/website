Before we start, this article does not coontains an answer to the title above. It's more of like an [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) that I (and probably you too), as an engineer, trying to decode and figure out how it works and how it can benefits us.

Think of this as a [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) question. I'm still looking for an answer and just wanted to let anyone who might be interested in this topic know.

## The problem

I am by no means a professional salesman (well except if you count [everyone as a salesperson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-8M4VmdGFg)). I've pitched "formally" (whatever that means) quite a few times. But, that really doesn't give me an "experienced"-title for me at all.

If you tell me to sell a pen, I'll probably ended up to be like [that nervous guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCfntaYBeqs).
