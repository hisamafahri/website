You know the hardest thing that I need to endure —and needs to be resolved as soon as possible— in my day-to-day life so far? The answer is to *figure out what needs to be done*.

Other people out there (which I do not know if my assumption is true or false) are constantly needing to figure out how to be productive and how to be efficient in their lives.

It's a little bit confusing to me. *Does anyone really know what to do?*

[Paul says](https://paulgraham.com/do.html) that we should "make good new things". That sounds abstract. But, not gonna lie, I am still looking for my "good new things".

## How to Find Things to Do?

Really, guys? How did you figure this question out? No, I am not talking about what to do in your 9-5 job (in case you are like me by the time you write this article). I am talking about really "what to do" in your life.

A lot of people say that [we should just do the thing](https://x.com/sama/status/1870527558783218106). I am starting to question whether my risk aversion is the problem.

Or, probably, I am that guy who keeps looking for that "billion-dollar idea" while rarely putting something on the table for the market to try.

Which one (or probably both of them) is the problem? Or probably something else entirely?
