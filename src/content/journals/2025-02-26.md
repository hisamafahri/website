## Who is this guide for?

Any **engineers** who are building any form of GUI applications (web, mobile, desktop apps, etc).

## What will this guide focus on?

This guide will focus on the _looks_, not on how your apps behave (user experience). There are resources out there that can serve you better on the latter.

## Rule 1: Don't use Montserrat

- Use more "neutral" fonts. If you're not sure there are two safe options: - Use the system's default font - [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
  > And as the title goes: Don't use the damn [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) (yes, I am looking at you, all the "corporate" sites).
- Serif font? It's hard to get it right. _Avoid it if possible._ If you have to:
  - Use Serif for the headings/title, and Sans-Serif as the body text
    - Serif follows the Sans-Serif, not the other way around
  - If you build a site like [gwern](https://gwern.net/) (or something with full of Serif font): **be careful on the font weight**!

## Rule 2: Colors

- Don't use pure black (`#000`) or pure white (`#fff`), unless you know what you're doing (which you probably don't).
- Don't reinvent the wheel on the colour set. Use [TailwindCSS colour guides](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) or something similar.
  - This applies whether you use dark mode/light mode.

## Rule 3: Icons? Be consistent!

- Be consistent. If you use outline, fill, or duotone, pick one and be consistent
  - Don't be like [Grok](https://x.com/ybhrdwj/status/1882925104453267932)

## Rule 4: Spacing

Remember this sequence:
`1 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 - 10 - 12 - 16 - 18 -20 - 24 - 28 - 32 - 36 - 40 - 48 - 64 - 72 - 80 - 96`
The important bit is: **Except for `1`, there's no odd number spacing**.

## Rule 5: Opacity?

- Don't use it! Use a different colour instead (see rule #2).

I read [this book](https://www.refactoringui.com/) a few years ago. I think it's a good resource if you want to dive deeper into this.
