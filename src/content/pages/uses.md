## uses

A collection of things that I use day-to-day to do things and improve things.

## software

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - my primary weapon. You can check out [my configuration](https://github.com/hisamafahri/dotfiles);
- [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) - the best terminal out there for me;
- [Atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin) - my command history manager. Because my command hitory is precious;
- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - can't stand to use regular git cli all the time;
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - simple, get things done;
- Few [custom CLI scripts](https://github.com/hisamafahri/dotfiles/tree/main/cli) - improve my workflow;
- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) - where all my notes (aka. my second brain) belongs.
