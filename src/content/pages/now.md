## now

I have been trying my best to have a lot of meaningful things to do every moment of my life. Here's what I have been up to lately:

- Living in BSD City, ID;
- Product & engineering at Workmate;
- Building [Thingpie](https://thingpie.com);
- Reading a lot of books, articles, and newsletters.
- Writing a ton. On my [journal](https://hisam.dev/journals), on my [digital](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview) with [logseq](https://logseq.com), and on [my pen and paper](https://hisam.dev/uses);
- Learning Piano and learning to play golf (don't expect too much on both of them ðŸ˜…);
- Wanting to pay a visit to [sst](https://sst.dev);
- Exploring the idea of writing a book on a self-taught developer journey;
