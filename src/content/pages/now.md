## now

I have been trying my best to have a lot of meaningful things to do every moment of my life. Here's what I have been up to lately:

- Living in BSD City, ID;
- Product & engineering at [Workmate](https://workmate.asia);
- "Stealthing" something ðŸ¤«;
- Reading a lot of books, articles, and newsletters (mostly from the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com));
- Writing more:
  - On my [journal](https://hisam.dev/journals) and on [my pen and paper](https://hisam.dev/uses);
  - Grow my [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) ðŸŒ±;
- Learning Japanese language (still super basic and just getting started);
- Occasionally learning Piano getting more serious learning to play golf;
