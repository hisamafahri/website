## now

I have been trying my best to have a lot of meaningful things to do every moment of my life. Here's what I have been up to lately:

- Living in BSD City, ID;
- Product & engineering at [Workmate](https://workmate.asia);
- Building [Thingpie](https://thingpie.com);
- Reading a lot of books, articles, and newsletters (mostly from the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com));
- Writing more. On my [journal](https://hisam.dev/journals), on my [digital](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview) with [logseq](https://logseq.com), and on [my pen and paper](https://hisam.dev/uses);
- Wanting to write my own "life documentations" (inspired by [this](https://luke.hsiao.dev/blog/housing-documentation) articles);
- Learning more in depth more about low-level programming languages, especially [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>);
- Occasionally learning Piano getting more serious learning to play golf;
