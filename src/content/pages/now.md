## now

I have been trying my best to have a lot of meaningful things to do every moment of my life. Here's what I have been up to lately:

- Living in BSD City, ID;
- Focusing on _Ramadhan_ fasting this month, and welcoming _Eid al-Fitr_;
- Working as a Software Engineer at Pitik;
- Building [Thingpie](https://thingpie.com);
- Reading a lot of books and articles. Currently reading [the Alchemist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144590-the-alchemist);
- Writing a ton. On my [journal](https://hisam.dev/journals), on my [digital](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview) with [logseq](https://logseq.com), and on [my pen and paper](https://hisam.dev/uses);
- Learning Piano and learning to play golf (don't expect too much on both of them ðŸ˜…);
- Wanting to revisit [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and learn [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). Read [why](/journals/2024-03-20);
- Exploring the idea of writing a book on a self-taught developer journey;
