I have been trying my best to have a lot of meaningful things to do every moment of my life. Here's what I have been up to lately:

- Living in BSD City

- Product & engineering at [Persol APAC](https://www.persol-group.co.jp/en/)

- Reading a lot of books, articles, and newsletters (mostly from the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com))

- Writing more here and mostly on [my pen and paper](/uses)

- Grow my [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) 🌱

- Opening up a new Business
