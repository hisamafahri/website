I have been trying my best to have a lot of meaningful things to do every moment of my life. Here's what I have been up to lately:

- Living in BSD City;
- Product & engineering at [Persol APAC](https://www.persol-group.co.jp/en/);
- Reading a lot of books, articles, and newsletters (mostly from the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com));
  <!-- - Currently reading [DHH's book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38900866-it-doesn-t-have-to-be-crazy-at-work) and [The Odin Book](https://odinbook.com/); -->
- Writing more:
  - On my [journal](https://hisam.dev/journals) and on [my pen and paper](https://hisam.dev/uses);
  - Grow my [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) 🌱;
- Learning Mandarin (汉语);
- Opening up a new Business
