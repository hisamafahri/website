# Start Things from Scratch
`06 Jul 2024`

With the recent announcement of the standalone [Ladybird browser](https://ladybird.org/) project, I've had a moment of realization that piqued my inner self and probably can be called a moment of realization for me.

I've known [SerenityOS](https://serenityos.org/) project for a while, and once in a while I just randomly watched [Andreas](https://www.youtube.com/@awesomekling) video updates and livestreams every once in a while.

In particular, what amazed me was that SerenityOS has its own culture for creating things from scratch.

Quoting from Ladybird's [website](https://ladybird.org/):

> ..., the browser uses various libraries from the SerenityOS project, which has a strong culture of writing everything from scratch.

And what piqued me was the fact that I (myself) naturally am doing this culture a ton of times. Those feelings are raging especially when facing new codebases.

## Why?

From my own perspective, starting things from scratch is a _slow_ but sure way to understand a thing as a whole. It sure does take a ton of time (like seriously a ton) and persistence. But, the benefits (believe it or not) are _often times_ outweigh its cost.

A lot of people are probably would disagree with this culture. And that's fine. I also realize not every project is suitable for this approach. But from my limited experiences, often times it's a really good bargain.
