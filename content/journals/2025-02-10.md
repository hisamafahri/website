I have been AI-less[^1] for quite a while now. A lot of cool stuff happens in the AI world honestly. Starting from the [Deepseek](https://deepsek.com) [$1T entrance](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-deepseek-ai-sparks-trillion-in-u-s-tech-destruction/), up until now a new [reasoning-stuff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387) which I honestly doesn't fully understand it either.

But even though a lot of —definetily cool stuff—, what I would like to talk about is how we uses it. Especially in the programming world.

Here's my take: "A lot of people are basically ruining the enjoyment of programming itself by using AI excessively".

Why? AI was designed as a support tool for us a human to assist what we strive to achieve either faster, more efficient, higher quality, or a combination of all of them.

But, instead, we become too dependent on it and just plainly accept what AI has to offer.

> A lot of people use AI to delegate their thinking, not [delegating their tasks](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/11/microsoft_study_ai_critical_thinking/). Let alone they even [delegate their understanding](https://stephango.com/understand).

## The Excitement

The excitement (and the stress of course) of encountering bugs, reading through the documentation, making adjustments, trying again, and again, and again up until you've finally reached the result you've been so longing to achieve, isn't it fun?

A lot of people can have any purpose of why they do things. Expecially why they do programming. But, while we're at it, why not enjoying every little things in it and grow our perception and understanding of it?

> _The worst part is: we've trade a lifetime of enjoyment and mastery so we can ship faster and maybe impress some dudes in Silicon Valley._

[^1]: No GitHub Copilot or any AI stuff like that in my main [programming gears](/uses). Just occasionally visit [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) or [Claude](https://claude.ai). Can I count it as totally AI-less? I don't think so. But, my interactions with AI have been super minimal compared a lot of people honestly.
